singularityChess
================

The goal of this project is to be able to play games of singularity chess without arguing over the rules.

singularityChess uses the Meteor.js framework: http://meteor.com/
a snapshot can be viewed at http://singularity.meteor.com
though it is not guaranteed to be up to date with this repository.

The D3 library is used for the user interface.  It is not explicitly imported, but included with the meteor package.
More information on D3 can be found at http://d3js.org/

Singularity chess is not well documented, a task that should be (but is not yet) included in this project.
some information on this chess variant can be found here: http://pmburgess.blogspot.com/2006/06/singularity-chess.html
Please note that singularityChess does not implement the pawn hack where the edge pawns 'curve' when advancing two squares.
