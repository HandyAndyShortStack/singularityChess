singularityChess
================

The goal of this project is to be able to play games of singularity chess without arguing over the rules.

singularityChess uses the Meteor.js framework: http://meteor.com/
a snapshot can be viewed at http://singularity.meteor.com
though it is not guaranteed to be up to date with this repository.

The D3 library is used for the user interface.  It is not explicitly imported, but included with the meteor package.
More information on D3 can be found at http://d3js.org/
